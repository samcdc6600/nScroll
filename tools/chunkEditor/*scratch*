;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.


I have the code:


	char lowByte = static_cast<char>(lookAhead.size() & 0xFF);
	char highByte = static_cast<char>((lookAhead.size() >> 8) & 0xFF);
	
	compressedChunk.push_back(highByte);
	compressedChunk.push_back(lowByte);


where compressedChunk is a vector of chars that is saved to a file.

This file is then read in.
Here is some of the code that reads in the file.

Assuming that the current position in the file is the first byte of
lookAhead.size() that written out.

The print statement should output the value of lookAhead.size() that was saved
to the file. However it doesn't. What do you think the problem is?


	char highByte {}, lowByte {};
	file>>highByte;
	file>>lowByte;

	std::cout<<((static_cast<unsigned char>(highByte) << 8) |
			  static_cast<unsigned char>(lowByte))
			       <<'\n';
