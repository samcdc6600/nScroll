We've installed compiledb using pip and it put the compiledb command in
"/home/crayxmp/.local/bin/compiledb". "/home/crayxmp/.local/bin/" Is in out
$PATH variable. and r and x are set on compiledb. However when we try to run it
it isn't found. So we are just going to use the absolute path for now as we
can't be bothered to figure out what's going on here.
