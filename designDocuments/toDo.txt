"+" mean's done.


* ---> (22) MUST DO 21 FIRST!
	    Fix player and view port movement.
	    	when the player moves within the view port the player's position
		is updated as well as the relative view port position (which
		should be updated by the opposite amount as the view port should
	    	not move in this case), but when the player touches the padding
		only the players position is updated. Since the absolute view
	        port position is calculated from the relative view port plus the
	        player view port this behaviour will mean that when the player
	        is not touching the padding (and moving in it's direction) the
	        view port will not move however the player's position will
	        change weather the view port moves or not (which is what we want
	        since we need the players absolute position.)
* ---> (21) Fix issue's with initial player and view port position (related to
	    the configuration variables initialViewPortCoordinatePlayerRelative,
	    viewPortPadding and initialCoordinate.
* ---> (20) Find out (and fix) what is causing a blank line to occasionally be
	    printed.
*? ---> (19) Convert functions in levelRules.* that deal with the player sprite
	    to be more general and work with anything that inherits the sprite base
	    class.
*? ---> (18) Fix sprite bug. Start program move character right and wait to hit
            the end of the level (this may not be required), attach debugger and
            step through. Notice that some of the characters are out of place on
            one of the frames (this may be a problem with the sprite file,
            however even if it is if you watch the sprite without the debugger
            attached this frame goes by very fast. Thus there is definitely
            something wrong.)
* ---> (14) Fix compilation warnings and then try to fix them as they come up.
*? ---> (12) Add code to the constructor for player to populate the vairables
            topCollisionOffset, bottomCollisionOffset, rightCollisionOffset and
	    leftCollissionOffset using values read in from the sprite file/s.
	    The values are currently hard coded.
