"*" mean's to do.
"*?" mean's maybe to do.
"+" mean's done.


* ---> (19) Convert functions in levelRules.* that deal with the player sprite
	    to be more general and work with anything that inherits the sprite base
	    class.
* ---> (18) Fix sprite bug. Start program move character right and wait to hit
            the end of the level (this may not be required), attach debugger and
            step through. Notice that some of the characters are out of place on
            one of the frames (this may be a problem with the sprite file,
            however even if it is if you watch the sprite without the debugger
            attached this frame goes by very fast. Thus there is definitely
            something wrong.)
* ---> (17) Convert all functions that return coordinates as strings in
	    player.hpp to be private and have two functions that force the
	    original function to use bottomCollisionDirectOffset or
	    bottomCollisionOneOffOffset and their equivalents for the x axis.
*? --> (16) Change all errors to use error handling code from NESEmu (also
	    replace code that uses exceptions.)?
* ---> (15) Change all error messages to include the file name. This should be
	    achieved by adding a static string called NAME_OF_THIS_FILE to the
	    top of each .cpp file. For any functions in .hpp files a variable of
	    the same name should be declared in the function.
* ---> (14) Fix compilation warnings and then try to fix them as they come up.
* ---> (13) Create sprite (called something different) class for enemy sprites
	    (as they need to handle things like collision and also automated
	    movement and the base class should only be used for things the
	    player won't interact with like trees.)
* ---> (12) Add code to the constructor for player to populate the vairables
            topCollisionOffset, bottomCollisionOffset, rightCollisionOffset and
	    leftCollissionOffset using values read in from the sprite file/s.
	    The values are currently hard coded.

* ---> (11) Add physics code to handle b (boarder) characters.

+ ---> (10) Figure out problem where input doesn't revert back to 0 on next
	     loop.
	     
+ ---> (9) Add check in init code for invalid initial player positions
	    (playerInnerBoarder!) (This has basically been covered by the fix
	    for 1, however the sprite will be able to be mostly off of the
	    bottom right of the map. We don't think this is a real problem
	    though, since the sprite will still technically be on screen)
	    
+ ---> (8) Fix problem with player sprite not changing animation when direction
	    is changed.
	    
+ ---> (7) Implement and possibly rename inBounds func and rewrite
	    inScreenBounds to use it and then use inBounds in movePlayer.
	    
+ ---> (6) Implement basic boundry handling code.

+ ---> (5) Fix lock up problem >':(.

*? --> (4) Just go ahead a make rules struct a class called
	    physics.
	    
+ ---> (3) Fix graphical sprite anomalies when switching between
	   player directions and sprite files are set up a certin way.
	    
+ ---> (2) Finish the default in setUpBoundryCoordsVector.

+ ---> (1) Add bound's checking into rules.lev parsing code.
