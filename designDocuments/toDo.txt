"*" mean's to do.
"*?" mean's maybe to do.
"+" mean's done.

(+)-->	(1) Add bound's checking into rules.lev parsing code.
(+)-->  (2) Finish the default in setUpBoundryCoordsVector.
(+)-->  (3) Fix Graphical sprite anomalies when switching between
	    player directions and sprite files are set up a certin way.
(*?)-->	(4) Just go ahead a make rules struct a class called physics.
(+)-->	(5) Fix lock up problem >':(.
(*)-->	(6) Implement basic boundry handling code.
(+)-->	(7) Implement and possibly rename inBounds func and rewrite
	inScreenBounds to use it and then use inBounds in movePlayer.
(+)-->	(8) Fix problem with player sprite not changing animation when direction
	    is changed.
(+)-->	(9) Add check in init code for invalid initial player positions
	    (playerInnerBoarder!) (This has basically been covered by the fix
	    for 1, however the sprite will be able to be mostly off of the
	    bottom right of the map. We don't think this is a real problem
	    though, since the sprite will still technically be on screen)
(*)-->  (10) Figure out problem where input doesn't revert back to 0 on next
	     loop.
(*)-->  (11) Add physics code to handle b (boarder) characters.
